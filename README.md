# Memory Matcher Game 
I will crate a memory matching game with 6 of Nba teams pictures .It will be contain  12 cards with 4x3 grid.
There are exactly 2 of every 6 teams pictures.If they match leave them up.If not, it will be flip both back over.
There will be score, it will start counting when the player click the one of the card.

 When every card is face-up, you win.And it will alert Congrats! text with picture. 
If the player  wants to restart the game there will be restart button.When the player click the restart button it  will give an alert  if the player wants to continue to restart the game  needs to click ok or click  cancel the restart choice.
Good luck!
